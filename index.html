          <h3>1. Pokemon Sword and sheild</h3>
          <ol>
          <p>1. What is a pokemon game. To know what a pokemon game is you have to know what pokemon are.Pokemon are like animals.They are found everywhere in the world of pokemon.The difference between animals and pokemon is that they have move sets.Pokemon can battle.Not like biting each other(even though there is a move called bite). They proform moves like ember,water gun and razor leaf.Every move has a type.Ember is a fire type move,water gun is a water type move,and razor leaf is a grass type move. All pokemon have types too if they use a move the type that they are it does more damage.It also does more damage if it is super efective.Fire is super effective against grass,grass is super effective against water and water is super effective against fire.If you do it backwards it is not very effective.There are more types than water,fire and grass but you can just explore and find out what is super effective and not so effectve.In pokemon after you get registered for the gym challenge you get on with your journey.Your goal in pokemon is to beat the 8 gym leaders(the gym leaders give you the badges you need to enter the pokemon league(the pokemon league is a place where you battle the other people who beat the gym leaders and make it up to the champion)become the champion of Galar(the "country or region you are in") and save the world from peiral.For more info watch this video. Sorry that it is a bit out of date(this pokemon game does not have the elite 4).

          <li> 2.Graphics. Pokemon shield has great graphics and they really show it off when battling your rival.The graphics really help show us the beauty of the Galar religion.I like the graphics a lot.Except for some ugly trees in the wild area.

          <li>3.Your rival. In Pokemon sword and shield you quickly meet your 1st rival.His name is Hop.Hop is a different rival from the rest.One reason is that Hops brother is the champion. Another reason is that he has a struggle that leads to an emotional part of the story.At first he is cheerful and confident but later on in the story he gets depressed. After a hard lost battle hop starts to think that he is bringing down his brothers good name. Later on in the story hop gets over his battle and gets on with trying to become the champion.

        <div class="box-1">  
          <li>4.Gym leaders.The gym leaders have stories just like hops but less emotional(the storys are in the leage cards).Gym leaders can reflect the town they are in like Milo the first gym leader or melony the sixth gym leader in sheild.There are 8 gym leaders and a order you have so beat them. First is Milo the grass type gym leader,second is Nessa the water type gym leader,after that is Kabu the fire type gym leader, next is Alister the ghost gym leader(If you have pokemon sword you get Bea the fighting type gym leader) fifth is Opal the fairy type gym leader. Soon after is Melony the ice type gym leader(Gordie the rock type gym leader if you have a sword),seventh is Peires the dark type gym leader and finally raihan the dragon type gym leader.

          <li> 5.Starters. There are three starters Scorebunny the fire type ,groukey the grass type and sobble the water type.My favorite is Scorebunny because it has more type advantages to the gym leaders and it is so cute.

          <p>6.Rating. I think the game is good but it has a lack of dungeons and caves.The wild area is a great addition but it has some very low level pokemon and some high level pokemon.They also had it so that people would pop into existence in low range so i rate it a 9/10.For a full review watch this random youtube channels video.

          <p>1.What is Mario kart.Mario kart is a very popular racing franchise.All you do is choose a grand pre(a series of 4 races and most races have 3 laps),character, kart, glider, and wheels.You can also do online play(where you can play online with your friends),time trials and more.Instead of just racing there are mystery boxes on the courses the mystery boxes contain a item that you can use to help yourself win.For more info watch this video.</p>

          <p>4.Review.I think that mario kart is a very good game the only complaint that i can think of is that i wish there was more to do other than battles and grand pre's. I give it a 10/10. </p>

          <p>4. Review.The Xbox one is an awsome gaming console however the controlers can get controller drift( a phenomenon in which your left or right stick moves to a side which makes it so that it is harder to play a game and your character moves on its own) which is really annoying.I rate it a 8/10
